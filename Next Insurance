InsuranceTech - Say goodbye to your Neighborhood Insurance Agent 

Next Insurance 

Founded in 2016

Next Insurance was founded by three executives. Please see below a summary of each of their experiences:

“Founder Guy Goldstein brings over 20 years of experience in all aspects of technology, product development, management and strategy. Prior to Next Insurance, he was the CEO of Check, a mobile payment company, which was acquired by Intuit for $360M. Previously, Guy served in an executive position of Corporate Development at HP software, responsible for mergers, acquisitions and strategy and before that, he spent 9 years in various R&D executive roles at Mercury Interactive. Guy holds a bachelor's degree in Business and computer science, cum laude, from the Tel-Aviv University and served in the Israeli Air Force as a major and fighter pilot.”  The other two co founders include Alon Huri and Nissim Tapiro.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The idea for next insurance came about because of the necessity in their industry. Some of the larger insurance carriers did not even hold 10 percent of the small business insurance market. There was a gap in the parket. There was also some deficiencies such as lack of customer service, lengthy turn around time on binding policies, and few carrier options. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The company was initially funded by a 13 million dollar seed fund. The company was able to obtain this because of their previous experience. According to Crunchbase, Next Insurance has raised a total of $881 million across six rounds of venture capital funding.

Notable investors include CapitalG (Alphabet’s independent growth fund), Munich Re Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Redpoint Ventures, TLV Partners, Ribbit Capital, American Express Ventures, and more.

During the company’s recent Series E round, announced in April 2021, Next Insurance was valued at $4 billion.

While investments were split across 240 companies, a handful of ultra-large rounds moved the needle on funding totals this year. This includes late-stage rounds for health plan provider Collective Health, which raised $280 million; entrepreneur-focused Next Insurance, which pulled in $250 million; and cyber insurance provider Coalition, which secured $380 million in two separate financings this year.



## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The company is trying to solve the issues of taking too long to obtain insurance. In the insurance industry it has been typical that a quote or binding coverage can be daunting and lengthy. They are trying to solve the problem for business owners to obtain insurance quickly. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The company's intended set of customers are business owners. 

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Quick binding process. Ease of obtaining insurance quotes quickly. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) Next insurance uses over 32 technology products and services including HTML, HTML5, Google analytics, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. They also use SPF. LetsEncrypt, and other Google Apps. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Insurtech 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Major trends include the adaptability by consumers, but also by insurance agents to use technology. Most application used to be handwritten and just as a couple of years ago you were able to get quotes online. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Three aren't really other major companies that offer insurance to business like NEXT does. . However there are several other InsureTech companies that specialize in personal auto, homeowners, and health insurance. Some of those companies include Oscar, Bright Health, Clover Health, Amwell and Hippo Insurance.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The impact of this business has been tremendous over the insurance and technology spectrum. Small businesses are able to obtain insurance a lot easier and quicker. This has also helped agents because they are able to quote with NEXT and offer coverage to local customer at a much faster and more consistent pace. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
I think some of the core metrics that companies use is the ability for users to use something new. For instance NEXT developed a first of its kind software which allows users to create live certificates to provide to their brokers. Over 52 million certificates were created in the first year. I believe that most companies want to see their new product being adapted into everyday lives and this is how they measure success. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
The company is performing amazingly. They are worth over 4 billion dollars and in the top five evaluations in the insurtech industry. Different sources have ranked them differently but they remain consistent at the top of the industry. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
I would encourage them to offer better phone support. They have offered alot of online support but more customers would like to speak to a live agent. I would also encourage them to cross sell into other lines of business such as personal because that will increase retention of clients can have all their insurance needs et in one place. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Higher retention and bigger premium. Largest premiums and highest potential for big revenues. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 
Thai would utilize Machine learning. Since Next insurance is an insurance carrier they will always have to continue to evolve. Machine learning will help them distinguish between a good and bad risk. This will help them underwrite their policies and make them more profitable. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Python coding to create an online rater. This would have to be calculated by using loss ratios.
